Basic carrousel using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, created as a learning project.

CSS can and would need to be further developped.

HTML can be further developped, image links in the img tags need to be changed based on images wanted

Javascript can be further developped, currently the script manages the visibility of each image one by one upon button click "Previous" and "Next". The script also manages the "return to first image" or "go to last image" based on the array.
